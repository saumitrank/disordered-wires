Welcome to disordered_wires's documentation!
============================================

This project contains code to generate disordered graphene nanoribbons and calculate properties such as the spectrum and conductance. 
This is done primarily using the package KWANT for Python. 
There is also a class that allows one to perform calculations of properties using the Recursive Greenâ€™s Function (RGF) technique for a more general system.
